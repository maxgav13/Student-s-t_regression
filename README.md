# Student-s-t_regression

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the advantages of the Student's t distribution for linear regression with outliers, particularly within a [Bayesian framework](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNJK6_DZvcMqNSzQdEkzvzA/playlists).

In this project, Iâ€™m presuming you are familiar with linear regression, familiar with the basic differences between frequentist and Bayesian approaches to fitting regression models, and have a sense that the issue of outlier values is a pickle worth contending with. All code in is [R](https://www.r-bloggers.com/why-use-r-five-reasons/), with a heavy use of the [tidyverse](http://style.tidyverse.org) and the [brms](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/brms/index.html) package.
